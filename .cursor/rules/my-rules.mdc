# SK-Quantum Research Project Assistant

## Project Overview

This research project investigates **whether complex number structure (fundamental to quantum mechanics) can be derived from computational substrates**, specifically SK combinatory logic.

### Research History

**Phase 0-3 (Completed)**: Investigated SK computation and quantum structure relationship
- **Main Finding**: Complex structure does NOT automatically emerge from SK computation
- **Paper**: Published as "On the Independence of Quantum Structure from SK Combinatory Logic"
- **Key Insight**: SK computation is fundamentally classical; phase can be computed but formula choice is arbitrary

**Phase 4 (Completed)**: Investigated reversible logic gates (Toffoli/Fredkin)
- **Main Finding**: Reversible gates are also classical — they embed into Sp(2n,ℝ), not U(n)
- **Key Result**: H1 SUPPORTED — "Reversible computation is classical"
- **Key Insight**: Permutation matrices have real eigenvalues (roots of unity), no ±i, thus no non-trivial J² = -I

**Phase 5 (Completed)**: Investigated continuous-time quantum walk
- **Main Finding**: Interference patterns detected in ALL test expressions!
- **Key Result**: Continuous-time evolution U(t) = exp(-iAt) introduces complex structure
- **Key Insight**: "Discrete → Continuous" limit is where quantum behavior emerges

**Phase 6-7 (Next)**: Model comparison and non-commutativity
- **Critical Question**: Is continuous-time sufficient for quantum structure, or is non-commutativity also needed?

## Current Phase: Phase 6 (Next)

### Phase 4: Algebraic Structure of Reversible Computation ✅ COMPLETED
- **Result**: Toffoli/Fredkin gates generate finite permutation groups
- **Result**: All embeddable in Sp(2n,ℝ) (classical symplectic)
- **Result**: No non-trivial J² = -I exists
- **Conclusion**: H1 SUPPORTED — Reversible computation is classical

### Phase 5: Hamiltonian and Interference ✅ COMPLETED
- **Result**: Interference detected in ALL test expressions!
- **Result**: Continuous-time U(t) = exp(-iAt) introduces complex structure
- **Result**: Quantum walk shows oscillating probability (vs classical monotonic convergence)
- **Conclusion**: "Discrete → Continuous" is key to quantum behavior

### Phase 6: Three-Model Comparison (Weeks 6-7) 🔄 NEXT
- Compare: SK (irreversible) vs RCA (reversible cellular automata) vs Quantum circuits
- Prediction: RCA with continuous-time should also show interference

### Phase 6: Three-Model Comparison (Weeks 6-7)
- Compare: SK (irreversible) vs RCA (reversible cellular automata) vs Quantum circuits
- **Prediction after Phase 4**: RCA will also be classical (permutation-based)
- Identify what makes quantum circuits different

### Phase 7: Non-commutativity and Quantization (Weeks 8-10)
- Analyze commutator [Ŝ, K̂]
- Non-commutativity is **the remaining candidate** for quantum structure
- Formulate "computational quantization"
- Write paper v2

## Key Hypotheses Status

| Hypothesis | Prediction | Status | Notes |
|------------|------------|--------|-------|
| H1: Reversible computation is classical | Closes in Sp(2n,ℝ) | ✅ **SUPPORTED** | Phase 4 confirmed (discrete) |
| H2: Interference requires non-commutativity | [X,Y]=0 implies no interference | **NEEDS REVISION** | Phase 5 shows interference without explicit non-commutativity |
| H3: RCA is equivalent to SK | Both classical | Pending | Phase 6 |
| H4: Quantization needs extra axioms | Computation alone insufficient | **PARTIAL** | Continuous-time is sufficient for interference |
| H5 (NEW): Continuous-time introduces quantum | exp(-iAt) brings complex structure | ✅ **SUPPORTED** | Phase 5 confirmed |

## Technical Notes

### Language
- Implementation: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, NetworkX, pytest
- Optional: Haskell for Phase 7, Coq for formal verification

### Testing
- All implementations should have comprehensive tests
- Current test count: **175 passing tests** (Phase 0-2: 144, Phase 4: 18, Phase 5: 13)

### Negative Results Are Valuable
This project values negative results equally:
- "Reversibility alone is insufficient" = **confirmed in Phase 4**
- "Computation is fundamentally classical" = important constraint
- Always document what doesn't work and why

## Response Guidelines

1. **Always respond in Japanese** (user preference)
2. When discussing theory, distinguish clearly between:
   - Symplectic structure (classical) — Phase 4 confirmed reversible gates are here
   - Complex/Kähler structure (quantum) — NOT achieved by reversibility alone
   - Discrete vs. continuous — key distinction identified in Phase 4
3. Reference specific documents when discussing plans or results
4. For implementation tasks, follow existing code style in `sk-quantum/`
5. Keep the critical stance: "reversible ≠ quantum" is now experimentally confirmed
