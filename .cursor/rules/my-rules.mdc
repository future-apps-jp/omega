# SK-Quantum Research Project Assistant

## Project Overview

This research project investigates **whether complex number structure (fundamental to quantum mechanics) can be derived from computational substrates**, specifically SK combinatory logic.

### Research History

**Phase 0-3 (Completed)**: Investigated SK computation and quantum structure relationship
- **Main Finding**: Complex structure does NOT automatically emerge from SK computation
- **Paper**: Published as "On the Independence of Quantum Structure from SK Combinatory Logic"
- **Key Insight**: SK computation is fundamentally classical; phase can be computed but formula choice is arbitrary

**Phase 4-7 (Planned)**: Investigating reversible computation and quantum structure
- **New Focus**: Whether reversibility (not just any computation) leads to quantum structure
- **Critical Stance**: "Reversibility ≠ Quantum" — classical Hamiltonian mechanics is also reversible
- **Core Question**: What is the boundary between classical (symplectic) and quantum (complex/Kähler) structure?

## Current Phase: Phase 4-7 Planning

### Phase 4: Algebraic Structure of Reversible Computation (Weeks 1-3)
- Analyze Toffoli/Fredkin gates instead of history-based SK
- Check if generated group is Sp(2n,ℝ) (classical) or U(n) (quantum)
- Search for complex structure J² = -I

### Phase 5: Hamiltonian and Interference (Weeks 4-5)
- Define Hamiltonian H = A (adjacency matrix of computation graph)
- Spectral analysis and quantum walk approach
- Check for interference patterns

### Phase 6: Three-Model Comparison (Weeks 6-7)
- Compare: SK (irreversible) vs RCA (reversible cellular automata) vs Quantum circuits
- Identify boundary conditions for quantum structure

### Phase 7: Non-commutativity and Quantization (Weeks 8-10)
- Analyze commutator [Ŝ, K̂]
- Formulate "computational quantization"
- Write paper v2

## Key Hypotheses to Test

| Hypothesis | Prediction | Falsification |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| H1: Reversible computation is classical | Closes in Sp(2n,ℝ) | Extends to U(n) |
| H2: Interference requires non-commutativity | [X,Y]=0 implies no interference | Interference with commutative structure |
| H3: RCA is equivalent to SK | Both classical | Only RCA is quantum-like |
| H4: Quantization needs extra axioms | Computation alone insufficient | Quantum structure derived |

## Technical Notes

### Language
- Implementation: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, NetworkX, pytest
- Optional: Haskell for Phase 7, Coq for formal verification

### Testing
- All implementations should have comprehensive tests
- Current test count: 123 passing tests (Phase 0-2)

### Negative Results Are Valuable
This project values negative results equally:
- "Reversibility alone is insufficient" = valid academic contribution
- "Computation is fundamentally classical" = important constraint
- Always document what doesn't work and why

## Response Guidelines

1. **Always respond in Japanese** (user preference)
2. When discussing theory, distinguish clearly between:
   - Symplectic structure (classical)
   - Complex/Kähler structure (quantum)
   - Reversibility vs. unitarity
3. Reference specific documents when discussing plans or results
4. For implementation tasks, follow existing code style in `sk-quantum/`
5. Keep the critical stance: avoid assuming "reversible = quantum"

## Shortcuts

- `/ask` — Policy consultation (multi-perspective analysis)
- `/plan` — Work planning (detailed outline)
- `/debug` — Bug investigation (5-7 hypotheses → narrow to 1-2)
- `/cmt` — Add comments/documentation
- `/log` — Add appropriate logging
