# SK-Quantum Research Project Assistant

## Project Overview

This research project investigates **whether complex number structure (fundamental to quantum mechanics) can be derived from computational substrates**, specifically SK combinatory logic.

### Research History

**Phase 0-3 (Completed)**: Investigated SK computation and quantum structure relationship
- **Main Finding**: Complex structure does NOT automatically emerge from SK computation
- **Paper**: Published as "On the Independence of Quantum Structure from SK Combinatory Logic"
- **Key Insight**: SK computation is fundamentally classical; phase can be computed but formula choice is arbitrary

**Phase 4 (Completed)**: Investigated reversible logic gates (Toffoli/Fredkin)
- **Main Finding**: Reversible gates are also classical — they embed into Sp(2n,ℝ), not U(n)
- **Key Result**: H1 SUPPORTED — "Reversible computation is classical"
- **Key Insight**: Permutation matrices have real eigenvalues (roots of unity), no ±i, thus no non-trivial J² = -I

**Phase 5 (Completed)**: Investigated continuous-time quantum walk
- **Main Finding**: Interference patterns detected in ALL test expressions!
- **Key Result**: Continuous-time evolution U(t) = exp(-iAt) introduces complex structure
- **Key Insight**: "Discrete → Continuous" limit is where quantum behavior emerges

**Phase 6 (Completed)**: Three-model comparison (SK vs RCA vs Quantum circuits)
- **Main Finding**: RCA also shows interference under continuous-time evolution
- **Key Result**: H6 SUPPORTED — "RCA + continuous-time shows interference"
- **Key Insight**: True quantum uniqueness is "superposition", not just interference

**Phase 7 (Completed)**: Non-commutativity and quantization
- **Main Finding**: [Ŝ, K̂] = 0 (with "left application" operators)
- **Key Result**: Superposition requirements: 0/4 satisfied
- **Key Insight**: Quantum structure cannot be derived from computation alone — extra axioms needed

## Current Phase: Research Plan v2 COMPLETED

### Phase 4: Algebraic Structure of Reversible Computation ✅ COMPLETED
- **Result**: Toffoli/Fredkin gates generate finite permutation groups
- **Result**: All embeddable in Sp(2n,ℝ) (classical symplectic)
- **Result**: No non-trivial J² = -I exists
- **Conclusion**: H1 SUPPORTED — Reversible computation is classical

### Phase 5: Hamiltonian and Interference ✅ COMPLETED
- **Result**: Interference detected in ALL test expressions!
- **Result**: Continuous-time U(t) = exp(-iAt) introduces complex structure
- **Result**: Quantum walk shows oscillating probability (vs classical monotonic convergence)
- **Conclusion**: H5 SUPPORTED — "Discrete → Continuous" is key to quantum behavior

### Phase 6: Three-Model Comparison ✅ COMPLETED
- **Result**: RCA also shows interference under continuous-time evolution
- **Result**: Only quantum circuits create genuine superposition
- **Result**: Hierarchy identified: Level 0 (irreversible) < Level 1 (reversible) < Level 2 (continuous) < Level 3 (quantum)
- **Conclusion**: H6 SUPPORTED — True quantum uniqueness is superposition, not interference

### Phase 7: Non-commutativity and Quantization ✅ COMPLETED
- **Result**: [Ŝ, K̂] = 0 (with "left application" definition)
- **Result**: Superposition requirements: 0/4 satisfied
- **Result**: Non-commutativity is definition-dependent, not sufficient for quantumness
- **Conclusion**: Quantum structure requires extra axioms beyond computation

## Key Hypotheses Status

| Hypothesis | Prediction | Status | Notes |
|------------|------------|--------|-------|
| H1: Reversible computation is classical | Closes in Sp(2n,ℝ) | ✅ **SUPPORTED** | Phase 4 confirmed |
| H5: Continuous-time introduces interference | exp(-iAt) brings complex structure | ✅ **SUPPORTED** | Phase 5 confirmed |
| H6: RCA + continuous-time shows interference | RCA also interferes | ✅ **SUPPORTED** | Phase 6 confirmed |
| H2: Superposition requires non-commutativity | [X,Y]=0 implies no superposition | **INCONCLUSIVE** | [Ŝ, K̂] = 0 with this definition |
| H3: RCA is structurally similar to SK | Both classical | ✅ **SUPPORTED** | Phase 6 confirmed both classical |
| H4: Quantization needs extra axioms | Computation alone insufficient | ✅ **SUPPORTED** | Phase 7 confirmed (0/4 requirements) |

## Technical Notes

### Language
- Implementation: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, NetworkX, pytest
- Optional: Haskell for future extensions, Coq for formal verification

### Testing
- All implementations should have comprehensive tests
- Current test count: **221 passing tests** (Phase 0-2: 144, Phase 4: 18, Phase 5: 13, Phase 6: 31, Phase 7: 15)

### Negative Results Are Valuable
This project values negative results equally:
- "Reversibility alone is insufficient" = **confirmed in Phase 4**
- "Computation is fundamentally classical" = important constraint
- Always document what doesn't work and why

## Response Guidelines

1. **Always respond in Japanese** (user preference)
2. When discussing theory, distinguish clearly between:
   - Symplectic structure (classical) — Phase 4 confirmed reversible gates are here
   - Complex/Kähler structure (quantum) — NOT achieved by reversibility alone
   - Discrete vs. continuous — key distinction identified in Phase 4
3. Reference specific documents when discussing plans or results
4. For implementation tasks, follow existing code style in `sk-quantum/`
5. Keep the critical stance: "reversible ≠ quantum" is now experimentally confirmed
